            <p>"The owner of this store is amazing! After picking out my bridesmaid dresses a few days ago I
                wasn't
                entirely happy with the colour. I contacted the owner today and within an hour she had not only
                found a colour I love, she contacted her suppliers and found the exact dress in that colour!
                Now
                that is customer service! She takes the time to get to know what you want and is super
                friendly! I
                can't recommend her enough!"</p>

            <p>I wanted to take a moment to submit a review! I found my wedding dress at Kelyta's and not only
                was
                my dress incredible, but she and her daughter were amazing to work with! My bridesmaid, maid of
                honour and my baby (our ring bearer!) also found their dresses/ suits there! These ladies are
                phenomenal to deal with and made our experience so special and memorable! I would definitely
                recommend Kelyta's to anyone - you won't be disappointed! Thank you so much ladies!"</p>
