            <p>Kayleen Trajtman is the creative entrepreneur behind Kelyta's Creation. Kayleen started to
                launch
                her children's clothing line in Canada at St Mary's Parish in Barrie. Father Sheehy and the
                patrons
                of the church allowed her to display communion dresses at church after mass.</p>
            <p>People at church loved her beautiful designs and from that blessed beginning she worked hard to
                promote Kelyta's Creation and two years later she went into the wholesale business and then in
                2006
                she launched her retail stores and the rest is now part of her successful history.</p>
            <p>Kelyta's Creation is a fourth generation family business and a one stop shop for all your bridal
                gowns, bridesmaids and mother of the bride dresses, flower girl dresses, first communion gowns,

                be
